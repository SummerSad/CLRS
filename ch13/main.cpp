// Red-black tree is a bst tree with one extra bit: color
// 1. Every node is either red or black
// 2. Root is black
// 3. Leaf (NULL) is black
// 4. If a node is red, both children are black
// 5. For each node, all simple path from the node to descendant leaves
// contain the same number of black nodes
// Single sentinel to represent NULL, its color: black
